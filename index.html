      Brief Description of Application
      <blockquote>
        Simple jump sprint game similar to the loss of internet connection game
        on Google. With simple sprites and obstacles potentially increasing in
        difficulty by speeding up the longer you survive. A score tab will also
        be included to see how far you have made it.
      </blockquote>

      Current Feature list

      <ul>
        <li>Simple Custom Sprites</li>
        <li>Simple Obstacles</li>
        <li>Score counter</li>
        <li>Simple background and asthetics</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        I met most of the originally proposed features but failed to implement
        increased difficulty, score saving for the scoreboard and custom
        obstacles. I did not expect I would have to have something to trigger
        the game and I was not able to implement such a feature.
